# Oh_Caml
I don't know you, but I'm about to.  

## Purpose
That long ago, a man who uses OCaml made fun of a man who uses Verilog.    
This repository is for who has never used OCaml.
Therefore, there are a lot of incorrect codes.
If you find some mistakes, please let me know by pull request or issue.
